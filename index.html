    <i>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.<br>Our deepest fear is that
    we are powerful beyond measure.<br>It is our light, not our darkness that most
    frightens us.<br>We ask ourselves,<br>who am I to be<br>brilliant,<br>
    gorgeous,<br>talented,<br>fabulous?<br>Actually, who are you not to be?<br>
    You are a child of God.<br>Your playing small does not serve the world.<br>
    There is nothing enlightened about shrinking<br>so that other people won't
    feel insecure around you.<br>We are all meant to shine,<br>as children do.<br>
    We were born to make manifest the glory of God<br>that is within us.<br>
    It's not just in some of us;<br>it's in everyone.<br>And as we let our own
    light shine,<br>we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
    <br>As we are liberated from our own fear,<br>our presence
    automatically liberates others."<i><br><br>- Marianne Williamson
