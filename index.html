    "With great power comes great responsibility."
    <br>
    "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that
    we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most
    frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented,
    fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your
    playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about
    shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all
    meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of
    God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And
    as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission
    to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence
    automatically liberates others." - Marianne Williamson
