    My Favorite Quotes:
    <p style="text-align:center;padding:20px">
      <i>"With great power comes great responsibility."</i>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
      <i>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.<br>Our deepest fear is that
      we are powerful beyond measure.<br>It is our light, not our darkness that most
      frightens us.<br>We ask ourselves,<br>who am I to be<br>brilliant, gorgeous,
      talented, fabulous?<br>Actually, who are you not to be?<br>
      You are a child of God.<br>Your playing small does not serve the world.<br>
      There is nothing enlightened about shrinking<br>so that other people won't
      feel insecure around you.<br>We are all meant to shine, as children do.<br>
      We were born to make manifest the glory of God<br>that is within us.<br>
      It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone.<br>And as we let our own
      light shine,<br>we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
      <br>As we are liberated from our own fear,<br>our presence
      automatically liberates others."<i><br><br>- Marianne Williamson
